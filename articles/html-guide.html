        <h1>1. Creating article file</h1>
        All articles must be stored in the <code>articles</code> folder of this repository. No nested directories are allowed as they will be ignored during the build.<br/><br/>
        File name must be concise, unique (within <code>articles</code> folder) and end with <code>.html</code> marking that it's an HTML file.<br/><br/>
        Be careful when choosing filename because it will be used as a path to the article (with <code>.html</code> ending trimmed).<br/><br/>
        <h2>2. Metadata</h2>
        At the start of the file a <em>metadata section</em> should be placed. That's where article title and authors are.<br/><br/>
        Format of the metadata section is following:
    </body>
</html>
